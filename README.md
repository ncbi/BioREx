## Environment:

* GPU: NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2
* Python: python3.9

## Installation

```bash
conda create -n biorex python=3.9
conda activate biorex
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train and evaluate BioREx

### Step 1: Download the datasets for BioREx

You can download [our converted datasets](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREx/datasets.zip), and unzip it to 

```
datasets/
```

If you want to convert the datasets by yourself, you can use the below script to convert original datasets into our input format.
```
bash scripts/build_biorex_datasets.sh
```

### Step 2: Download the pre-trained model

Please download the model [here](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedNLP-PubMedBERT-base-uncased-abstract)

Then put them into 

```
microsoft/
```

### Step 3: Train and evaluate

```
bash scripts/run_biorex_exp.sh <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES>
```

Please replace the above <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES> with your GPUs' IDs. Eg: '0,1' for GPU devices 0 and 1.
For example

```
bash scripts/run_biorex_exp.sh 0,1
```



## BioREx pre-trained models

You can download the BioREx pre-trained models:

* [BioREx BioLinkBERT model (Preferred)](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREx/pretrained_model_biolinkbert.zip) is utilized in the beta version of [PubTator3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/pubtator3/).
* [BioREx PubMedBERT model (Original)](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREx/pretrained_model.zip) 

## Predicting New Data:

If you only wish to use our tool for predicting new data without the need for training, please follow the steps outlined below:

Download the BioREx pre-trained model [BioREx model](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/BioREx/pretrained_model.zip) file and place it in the "BioREx/" directory.

Open the "scripts/run_test_pred.sh" file and modify the values of the variables "in_pubtator_file" and "out_pubtator_file" to match your input PubTator file (with annotations) and the desired output PubTator file (where predicted relations will be stored).

Execute the following script to initiate the prediction process:

```
bash scripts/run_test_pred.sh <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES>
```

Please replace the above <CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES> with your GPUs' IDs. Eg: '0,1' for GPU devices 0 and 1.
For example

```
bash scripts/run_test_pred.sh 0,1
```
